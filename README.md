# MULTI-UTILITY-CONVERTER
Objectives of the Project

To develop a multi-purpose unit conversion system using the C programming language.

To provide accurate and fast conversions for various measurement units such as length, area, volume, temperature, mass, and currency.

To create a user-friendly, menu-driven interface that allows users to easily navigate and perform conversions.

To understand and implement modular programming logic and mathematical conversion formulas in C.

To demonstrate practical usage of conditional statements, loops, and input/output operations in a real-world application.

To allow users to perform multiple operations in a single run until they choose to exit.

To design a single application that replaces multiple separate conversion tools with one integrated system.

✅ Features of the Project
⭐ 1. Length Converter

Converts between meters, kilometers, and centimeters.

Supports both forward and reverse conversions (e.g., m → km and km → m).

⭐ 2. Area Calculator

Calculates area using Length × Breadth.

Useful for basic geometry-based calculations.

⭐ 3. Volume Calculator

Calculates volume using Length × Width × Height.

Helpful for measuring storage, tank volume, etc.

⭐ 4. Currency Converter

Converts between INR, USD, and EUR.

Includes example exchange rates for demonstration.

Users can convert in both directions (INR ↔ USD, INR ↔ EUR).

⭐ 5. Temperature Converter

Covers essential temperature conversions:

Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit

Celsius ↔ Kelvin

Kelvin ↔ Celsius

Uses accurate scientific formulas.

⭐ 6. Mass/Weight Converter

Converts between kilograms, grams, and pounds.

Supports both forward and reverse conversions.

⭐ 7. Menu-Driven Interface

Clean and simple navigation.

Allows users to perform unlimited conversions until they exit.

⭐ 8. Highly Accurate Calculations

Uses double datatype for precision.

Ensures conversions are mathematically correct.

⭐ 9. Error-Free and Portable

Works on all C compilers (Turbo C, GCC, CodeBlocks, VS Code, OnlineGDB).

No external libraries required.

⭐ 10. Real-World Application

Can be used by students, engineers, shopkeepers, travelers, and general users for quick unit conversions.
